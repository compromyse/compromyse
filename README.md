Student and hacker
------------------

#### I’m a student living in Bangalore, India. I am a fan of hacking and programming. I’m also interested in deep learning, soccer and basketball.

I started my journey by learning about Android, rooting and custom ROMS. Around ~2016 I started learning Linux with a [Raspberry Pi 3B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/). It began with trying out things like [wine](https://www.winehq.org/) and emulation. One of the things I wanted to do was running x86 programs on the RaspberryPI, which is ARM. This made me learn about CPU architectures. This project helped me learn a lot about Linux, which in retrospect, is very crucial. I started exploring hacking early on, in ~2017. I used Android tablets and phones, with termux and Custom ROMS on them. This helped me learn a lot about how Android APKs work and how Android works in general. Later on, in ~2020 I explored photo, video and audio editing. I also learned a little about 3D modeling. Through it all, my curiosity kept me going.
